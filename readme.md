# Risen Soul Kit
Risen Souls are monks whose years of meditations and spiritual enlightenment deeply connected them to their ki and, some believe, higher powers. While not physically as strong as other monks, they are able to channel that energy in combat both defensively and offensively. Risen souls are balanced fighters that can choose between three different styles and change freely during combat. They accumulate energy over time, until they release it. The more they wait, the more powerful their abilities become, though using any of them will consume that energy, which they will then have to wait to get back. Switching style also reset their energy accumulation.
    Kit specifics:
    - 2 Strength and Constitution
    May not use Lay on Hands, Stunning Blow or Quivering Palm
    May choose between three Styles in combat. While using any of those styles, the Risen Soul accumulates energy to unleash abilities specific to the combat style. More powerful abilities are granted from waiting longer. A new tier of abilities becomes accessible for waiting 10 seconds. This is reduced by 1 second every 4th level, starting at level 4, down to 5 seconds at level 20. Higher tier abilities are unlocked with levels.


While this kit should be fully playable and, I hope, enjoyable, it is also meant as a real-life demo of the ScaleSpell library I have made and that can be found here:

Feel free to use that library for your own mods and report any bug you find, on this mod or on the library!
